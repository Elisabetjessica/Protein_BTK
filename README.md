# Protein_BTK
This repository contains the workflow and code used in the structural analysis of Burton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK). The workflow integrates **PDB miner** for structure selection, **MutateX** for calculating local interaction and binding free energy, and **CABS-flex** for molecular dynamics simulations to assess structural flexibility.
