# Protein_BTK
This repository contains the workflow and code used in the structural analysis of Burton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) utilizing MAVISp framework. The workflow integrates **PDB miner** for structure selection, **MutateX** for calculating local interaction and binding free energy, and **CABS-flex** for molecular dynamics simulations to assess structural flexibility. 

## Project Workflow
This project workflow is as follow
1. Protein structure curation and selection with PDBminer
2. Solvent accessibility analysis with Naccess and folding free energy calculation with MutateX
3. Binding free energy calculation with MutateX
4. Molecular Dynamic simulation with CABS flex 2.0
5. Folding free energy calculation with MutateX Ensemble mode
